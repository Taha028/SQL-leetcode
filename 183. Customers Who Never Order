Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.


Another Approach

SELECT C.name AS Customers
FROM Customers C
WHERE C.id NOT IN (
SELECT c.id
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o
ON c.id=o.customerId);








One Way
SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.id=o.CustomerId
WHERE o.customerId IS NULL;
